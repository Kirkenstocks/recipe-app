# Recipe App

## Overview
This is a full-stack application built with Python's Django framework. Once authenticated, users can add and modify recipes with information like recipe name, cooking time, ingredients, and an image. A difficulty level is automatically calculated for each recipe as well. Users can search for recipes using ingredients as search parameters to find all recipes that use those ingredients.
